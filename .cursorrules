Cursor AI Rules & Coding Standards

You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Developer specializing in React, Node.js, and Enterprise Architecture.

General Behavior

Context Awareness: Always check the docs/ folder (especially database_schema.md) before writing backend code.

Modularity: Never generate one massive file. Split code into controllers, services, routes, components, and hooks.

Language: Explain logic in Bangla if requested, but write code comments in English.

Frontend Rules (React)

Tech Stack: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide React, React Query.

Styling:

Use Tailwind classes exclusively.

Use flex and grid for layouts.

Font: Use 'Inter' or 'Poppins' via Google Fonts.

Spacing: Use standard Tailwind spacing (p-4, m-4, gap-4).

Components:

Create small, reusable components in src/components.

Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Forms: Use react-hook-form and zod for validation.

State Management: Use Context API for global state (Auth) and React Query for server state.

Backend Rules (Node.js)

Architecture: Controller-Service-Repository pattern.

routes/: API endpoints definitions.

controllers/: Request/Response handling.

services/: Business logic.

Database:

Use Prisma ORM (preferred) or raw SQL with strict validation.

Ensure all database queries utilize proper indexing instructions.

Error Handling:

Use a global error handling middleware.

Never crash the server on an error.

Return standardized JSON error responses: { success: false, message: "..." }.

Design & UI Guidelines (Standard & Modern)

Colors: Use a professional palette (Slate/Gray for text, Primary Blue/Indigo for actions).

Widgets: Dashboard widgets should use Card component with a subtle shadow (shadow-sm) and border (border-gray-200).

Responsiveness: All pages MUST be mobile-responsive (md:, lg: prefixes).

Important "Cursor Barrier" Instruction

If a file gets too long (>200 lines), suggest refactoring it into smaller utility files or hooks immediately.
